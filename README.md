# GSAP animations

https://mreyelet.github.io/GSAP-hero-animations/index.html

Animations done using GSAP library and CSS animations.
This design is from my dribbble profile, --> https://dribbble.com/shots/11404723-Survival.

During coding I changed some of the design's elements that I didnt like. Currently the 'ahrefs' link nowhere, because this is only demo version and I focused mostly on GSAP animations.

I hope you will like it :)
